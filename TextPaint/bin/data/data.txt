溫情聖誕有冇人要聖誕卡?For the past week three artists have been working at the ScreenLab / MediaCityUK, Salford University, an internal artist in residence initiative by Elliot Woods and Kit Turner to explore modes of perception and interaction under the theme ‘Future of Broadcast’. The invited artists, Kyle McDonald (USA), Joanie Lemercier (France) and Joel Gethin Lewis (UK) have been developing open source tools and methods for future students and artists (on and off campus) to remix and re-use. This process includes contributions from a group of talented on-campus students within the arts and art-technology crossover and students are involved with not only learning, but also in the creation of new digital media techniques.
