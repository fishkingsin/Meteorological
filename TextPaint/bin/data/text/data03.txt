Chapter 3 : Presence of the absence

"Air as lost time Voice
of a cloud, of a ghost crowned with nimbus
Smack-thin, it lingers
forty years. I thought it
came from the jeweled
world we’d seen.
Everything stuffed,
urgent, glittering alive But it was just pleasure,
blank and sure Now
what is there to sing.
From speakers, the tune
folds and fades in
waves.
Earphones drive it through your head"
 - Don Bogen
